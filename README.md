# Advent of Code 2018 â€” 2020

These are my solutions for some puzzle of the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/). I've participated since 2018 and I've written small blogposts in German about each day at the [Codestammtisch-blog](https://codestammtis.ch/) (it's a German podcast I host together with a very dear friend of mine).

To be honest: I'm not really good at this whole coding-thing in general or this advent of code-thing in particular. I (mostly) don't attend in order to learn a new language or solve the puzzles in an elegant or very clean way. I just want to get those two stars. Period. When I'm stuck over a couple of days or I'm frustrated I completely stop sometimes instead of skipping a day or two.

It's about fun, isn't it? I should tell that myself from time to time.

## Languages

In 2018 and 2020 I used [Python](https://www.python.org/), while in 2019 I tried to learn [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/), but as I haven't used it since then, I forgot almost everything about Ruby I ever learned, although I quite liked it, to be fair.
