# Advent of Code 2021 in Elixir

I'd like to solve as much as possible of the [2021 Advent of Code][aoc2021] using the [Elixir programming language][elixir]. Please note, that I'm a total beginner when it comes to this particular language. From time to time I will stream some stuff on the [Codestammtisch Youtube-channel][cst-yt]
